2023-11-05 Matplotlib

Program to search mazes and animate the search:

    python animated_search.py             # for arguments
    python animated_search.py dfs maze4
    python animated_search.py astar maze8star 500

-----------------------------------------------

Running matplotlib in this Ubuntu WSL env did not work out of the box.

This dir contains fixes.

1.  helloworld-gui.py - works and uses the Tkinter backend.
2.  animation.py      - works and also uses the Tkinter backend.   Animates a depth-first search.
3.  helloworld-agg.py - uses a non-GUI backend to make .png files.
4.  hello_world.png   - output of helloworld-agg.py

The important point is to include these two lines before other matplotlib imports:

    import matplotlib
    matplotlib.use('TkAgg')  # Use the Tkinter backend
    
Additionally, in the .bashrc I've added "dbus" commands to make it so gedit and other X progs do not get so many errors.
