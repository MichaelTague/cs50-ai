cs50-ai/maze/ dir contains a version of the 1st week's maze program that 
displays a maze in the web browser.

Eg use:

    python maze.py maze4

The maze1, maze2, etc., files are each different mazes.  quiz0q2 is the maze
from Quiz 0, Question 2.

maze4 is worst case for DFS though a bit better for BFS.
